Github is a web-based platform used for version control.
Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. 
Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.
You can also use it to showcase your codes and skills. 
Your github account is very important in getting jobs too. 
You can generally see which proggrammer is more serious by comparing their githubs. 
Anyway, if you are a programmer, I think Github is one of the most important, if not the most important part of your life.
